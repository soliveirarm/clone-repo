# Clone Repo

> Simple python script for devs how want to automate the process of cloning your github repository, just type in the name of it and you're done!

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) has to be installed
- VS Code as your IDE (if you wanna open it with code after it's cloned)

## How to use

1. Open `clone_repo.py` with VS Code
2. Change the **`USERNAME`** constant to your own
3. Run it with **python**, that's it!

## Tweaks

- By default the reposity is saved in '`Desktop/Projects`', if you want to change the the **`PROJECTS_PATH`** constant to the path you want.
