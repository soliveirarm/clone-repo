# Clone Repo

> Simple python script for devs how want to automate the process of cloning a github reposity

## Requirements

- Python has to be installed
- VS Code as your IDE (preferably)

## How to use

1. Open `clone-repo.py` with VS Code
2. Change the **`USERNAME`** constant to your own
3. Run it with **python**, that's it!

## Tweaks

- If you don't use VS Code, simply remove the _30th line_
- By default the reposity is saved in '`Desktop/projects`', if you want to change the the **`PROJECTS_PATH`** constant to the path you want.
